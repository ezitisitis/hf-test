    "description": "Hyperfusion is an official infrastructure partner of the Gonka network, providing end-to-end GPU hosting, deployment, and operations for Gonka mining and AI workloads. The service is designed for individuals, funds, and enterprises that want exposure to Gonka mining without managing hardware, collateral, or operations themselves. Hyperfusion supplies the physical infrastructure, software stack, monitoring, and operational support, while clients retain economic ownership of rewards and flexibility over custody and scale.",
    "role_of_hyperfusion": "Hyperfusion provisions, operates, and maintains GPU clusters connected to the Gonka network. This includes hardware sourcing, cluster assembly, software installation, collateral delegation, uptime monitoring, SLA enforcement, and ongoing lifecycle management. Clients interact with a managed service rather than raw infrastructure.",
    "relationship_to_gonka": "Hyperfusion has been participating in the Gonka network since genesis, operating thousands of GPUs across many epochs. The partnership is public, on-chain verifiable, and reflected through live dashboards and trackers."
